Detects noindexed Posts and Pages (via Yoast SEO or Genesis SEO) and removes them from search results and archives on your website.

== Description ==

When you noindex a Post or Page, you probably don't want people to find it unless you give them the link. This plugin detects noindexed Posts and Pages (via Yoast SEO or Genesis SEO) and removes them from search results and archives on your website.

= How to Use =

You should either have the Yoast SEO plugin or an active Genesis theme on your website. Either will allow you to 'noindex' your Posts and Pages (consult the documentation for details).

All you need to do is select the Posts and Pages you want to noindex and this plugin will automatically take care of removing them from your search results and archives.
